Welcome to your development environment
=======================================
So, you've completed most of the Khan Academy programming classes, and you 
want to do some real coding.

Cloud9 provides you everything you need to do real coding.

The thing is, for as much as you have learned so far, you're only not even
ankle deep into what real coding is all about.

Consider where you are
----------------------
Cloud9 is an interesting web application, in that it provides you a lot of 
power that you're probably taking for granted right now.

You think you've found a cool web app that lets you code, but Cloud9 is so 
much more.

A Cloud9 workspace is a window into the internals of another computer.  Even
more accurately, a Cloud9 workspace is a window into the internals of a 
computer running on virtualized hardware that, altogether, is an actual 
physical computer.

The files you are reading from and writing to are actually occyping disk space 
on that other computer - not your own.  You're seeing the raw form of that 
stored content that you don't otherwise see when you're browsing the web.

When you run the server, your code is being read by the other computer, 
compiled by the other computer, executed by the other computer, so that when
clients come calling on the network, they get an answer.

There's so many abstractions it's hard to talk about them succinctly and not
get overwhelmed.

Taking inventory
----------------
But the only way forward is to do things.  So lets consider what we have, 
and then discuss what we might need to do next.

### Ubuntu server
You'll mostly be interacting with Ubuntu via the bash terminal.

Here is a good list of [useful terminal commands](https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/244).

### Node.js environment

#### server.js


#### node_modules folder


#### client folder


##### structure


##### jQuery


##### Bootstrap

### git
Git is used for [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).

[Github](https://github.com) is used for hosting git repositories.

Github also provides an excellent tutorial on how to use git and github.  You
can find it [here](https://try.github.io/).

### Markdown
Markdown is an easy way of writing documentation that looks good both in
plain text and on the browser.
